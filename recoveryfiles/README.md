# Recovery Files
There are a number of files needed to build the RACHEL
recovery and production USBs. There are packages and items
stored on the large HD (as opposed to the eMMc) and they
need to be replaced when reformatting that drive.

## Recovery Files Are In Two Locations

### Smaller files are in github available here:

    `git clone https://github.com/worldpossible/RACHEL5.git`

    `cd RACHEL5/recoveryfiles`

### Larger files are on our dev server available here:

    `rsync://dev.worldpossible.org/rachel5/recoveryfiles/`

    `ftp://dev.worldpossible.org/rachel5/recoveryfiles/`
